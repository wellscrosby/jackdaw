//! Rendered thumbnails for `.glb` / `.gltf` entries in the asset browser.
//!
//! A folder of models used to browse as a wall of identical font glyphs,
//! which makes a 300-model kit unusable. This module photographs each model
//! off-screen once and caches the result as a PNG under the project's
//! `.jackdaw/thumbnails/`, so the second visit to a folder costs a file read
//! rather than a scene load and a GPU pass.
//!
//! The off-screen setup copies [`crate::material_preview`]: a camera with
//! `RenderTarget::Image`, its own [`RenderLayers`] so nothing leaks into a
//! viewport, and its own [`EnvironmentMapLight`] because lighting is
//! per-view rather than global. It differs in two ways: one target image is
//! reused for every model (the pixels are read back and written to disk, so
//! nothing needs to stay resident), and the whole thing is driven by a
//! bounded work queue rather than by a selection.
//!
//! Three rules the queue exists to keep:
//!
//! - **Never stall the editor.** At most one model is rendered at a time and
//!   at most `DISK_LOADS_PER_FRAME` cached PNGs are decoded per frame.
//! - **Never re-render what is already on disk.** The cache is keyed by path
//!   *and* source mtime, so an edited model regenerates and an untouched one
//!   never does, across editor restarts.
//! - **Never retry a model that failed.** A `.gltf` that cannot load is
//!   marked failed for that mtime and skipped until the file changes.
