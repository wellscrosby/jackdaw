# Custom components

Anything you can `#[derive(Reflect)]` can show up in the
editor's Add Component picker. There's no separate
registration step and no jackdaw-specific macro.

## Minimum

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(Component, Default)]
pub struct PlayerSpawn;
```

That's it. The editor builds your project's game binary in the
background when the project opens and extracts its type schema;
once that finishes, open the inspector on an entity, click
`+ Add Component`, type `PlayerSpawn`. It shows up.

If you add a component while the editor is already running, run
**Rebuild Project** (or `jd build` in a terminal) to pick
it up. Rebuilds are on request rather than automatic; **Toggle
Auto Build** switches to rebuild-on-source-change.

A few things make this work without ceremony:

- Bevy's `reflect_auto_register` registers the type when the
  schema extractor runs your game binary, so you don't need
  `app.register_type::<PlayerSpawn>()` and there is no
  jackdaw-specific registration code anywhere. A type in a
  dependency crate that your library never references can be
  stripped by the linker before registration runs; register it
  explicitly if it never shows up.
- `jackdaw_runtime` enables bevy's `reflect_documentation`
  feature, so doc comments on the type become picker tooltips.
- Jackdaw can construct a default-valued instance from
  primitive field defaults, so you don't strictly need
  `Default`. Adding it is just nicer.

## Categories and tooltip overrides

```rust
use jackdaw_runtime::prelude::*;

/// Spawns the player at this entity's world transform.
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(Component, Default, @EditorCategory::new("Actor"))]
pub struct PlayerSpawn;
```

The picker groups `PlayerSpawn` under "Actor". The doc comment
above the struct becomes the tooltip. If you want a tooltip
that's different from the doc comment (for example, the doc
comment is for rustdoc readers and the tooltip is for level
designers), use `@EditorDescription`:

```rust
#[reflect(
    Component,
    Default,
    @EditorCategory::new("Actor"),
    @EditorDescription::new("Where the player respawns."),
)]
pub struct PlayerSpawn;
```

## Viewport previews for markers

Tag a type with `@EditorPreview` and a gltf path under `assets/` 
to see a viewport preview for your marker in the editor.

```rust
use jackdaw_runtime::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(
    Component,
    Default,
    @EditorPreview::gltf("models/player.glb"),
)]
pub struct PlayerSpawn;
```

If the entity already has a brush, a glTF, or a mesh,
the overlay is skipped.

## Hiding a component from the picker

Sometimes a component is part of your plugin's internal
plumbing and shouldn't be authorable from the inspector.
`@EditorHidden` on the type drops it from the picker but
keeps the type registered for serialization:

```rust
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(Component, Default, @EditorHidden)]
pub struct PlayerInternalState {
    pub spawn_count: u32,
}
```

`EditorHidden` does double duty: as a reflect attribute on a
type (hides from picker), and as a Bevy `Component` on an
entity (hides the entity from the outliner). Same name, two
roles.

## Reacting to scene-loaded components

Use a normal `On<Insert, T>` observer:

```rust
fn spawn_player(
    trigger: On<Insert, PlayerSpawn>,
    transforms: Query<&GlobalTransform>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    let Ok(gt) = transforms.get(trigger.entity) else { return };
    commands.spawn((
        ChildOf(trigger.entity),
        // ... your player rig at gt's world position
    ));
}
```

`GlobalTransform` is correct here, even when the entity is
loading from a scene file. The scene loader propagates transforms
inline before firing observers, so you get the entity's true
world-space pose. You don't need `On<SceneInstanceReady>` or
the recursive-walk pattern from vanilla Bevy.

Register the observer in your plugin:

```rust
impl Plugin for GamePlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_observer(spawn_player);
    }
}
```

## Editor-only visuals

Sometimes you want a visual indicator at a spawn point that's
visible while authoring but absent from the shipped game.
`EditorOnly` is the marker:

```rust
fn spawn_player(
    trigger: On<Insert, PlayerSpawn>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,
) {
    commands.spawn((
        ChildOf(trigger.entity),
        EditorOnly,
        Transform::default(),
        Mesh3d(meshes.add(Cuboid::new(0.4, 0.4, 0.4))),
        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(StandardMaterial {
            base_color: Color::srgb(1.0, 0.2, 0.2),
            unlit: true,
            ..default()
        })),
    ));
}
```

The red cube renders in the editor. When the user saves, the
cube is skipped from the scene file. The shipped game never
sees it.

You can also do this entirely in the editor without code: make
a brush, set it as a child of an empty that holds your
component, then add `EditorOnly` to the brush from the
inspector. The empty + your component ships, the brush
doesn't.

`EditorOnly` skips the whole entity from save, so don't put it
on the same entity as your gameplay marker. The pattern is
always parent (gameplay component) plus child (editor visual
with `EditorOnly`).

## Common gotchas

**Component doesn't appear in the picker.** Almost always one
of:
- Missing `#[derive(Reflect)]`.
- Missing `#[reflect(Component)]`.
- Has `@EditorHidden` somewhere (intentional or pasted from a
  template).
- The project hasn't been rebuilt since you added the type. Run
  Rebuild Project or `jd build`.

**Doc comment doesn't show as tooltip.** Tooltips need bevy's
`reflect_documentation` feature. `jackdaw_runtime` turns it on;
if you patch or vendor your own bevy, make sure
`reflect_documentation` is in its feature list.

**`On<Insert, T>` runs but the entity has the wrong
GlobalTransform.** Shouldn't happen in current jackdaw. If it
does, file a bug. Older versions of jackdaw needed an
`On<SceneInstanceReady>` walk; that's gone now.

**Scene fails to load with a panic.** Probably your
`Cargo.toml` has `panic = "abort"` and a reflected component
in your scene file no longer matches its current type
definition (you renamed a field, changed a type, etc). The
deserialize step returns errors cleanly, but a genuinely
panicking insert kills the process. Fix the schema drift in
the scene file or the type. Jackdaw used to swallow these
panics with `catch_unwind`; it doesn't anymore, because that
was hiding real bugs.
